Hey, how&#39;d you get in here... this area is off limits! I&#39;d help show you the way out but I&#39;m reading an article my friend wrote that was recently published in the paper. I&#39;m so proud of him ;)

It just takes time for me to read this because I&#39;m not the swiftest reader. Let me give you all the necessary items to find your way out of the building.

The janitor gives you a few items...

Take a momement to appreciate this nice courtyard.

Look! There&#39;s a sheet of ice that&#39;s covering the water. How will the birdies take their bathies?
